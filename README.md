📊 Sport in Data Analysis

DEPI Graduation Project – Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative

Project Overview

This project explores how data analysis can be applied to sports to extract insights that support decision-making, performance evaluation, and strategic planning.

Sports generate massive amounts of data related to players, teams, matches, and outcomes. By leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques, this project aims to transform raw sports data into actionable insights for analysts, coaches, and decision-makers.

The exact use case and sport domain are currently under refinement.

Project Objectives

Apply data analysis techniques in a real-world sports context

Explore sports datasets to uncover meaningful patterns and trends

Design clear and effective visualizations for insights communication

Build an end-to-end analytical workflow from raw data to insights

Project Scope (Initial)

The project will focus on one or more of the following:

Player performance analysis

Team performance comparison

Match or season trend analysis

Key performance indicators (KPIs) in sports

Final scope will be finalized during the analysis phase.

Dataset Overview

The datasets will be selected from reliable public sports data sources, such as:

Historical match and player statistics

Team performance metrics

Season-level or competition-level data

Possible sources include:

Kaggle Sports Datasets

Open sports data platforms

Dataset details, size, and features will be updated once finalized.
